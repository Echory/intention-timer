# intention-timer

## Overview
Our app allows the user to create and store different activities and goals. This includes setting a timer that counts down the allotted time to complete the goal.

You can view and interact with the application [here](https://echory.github.io/intention-timer/)

Please view instructions below!

## How To Use

1. When you open the app you will see a home screen that displays three category options, an accomplish input, and a seconds input. Here you call fill out the inputs and click start activity.

2. Once the start activity button is clicked you will be taken to a timer page where you can start the timer and it will countdown.

3. When the countdown is complete, you may choose to log the activity which will save the completed activity for future viewing.
